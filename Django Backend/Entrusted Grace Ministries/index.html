<p>Susan Joy Emerton: All my life I have been influenced by a Godly Grandmother; who taught me to love God and have a deep respect for missions. She would invite and feed every missionary that ever visited our church as I was growing up. In December of 2012, after my Granny was called to her heavenly home, I started praying, asking the Lord to fill my heart with love. He gave me an in 2013 to meet some dear people from India. In February of 2014, I was blessed with the opportunity to visit India in person. While there God showed me exactly what I was supposed to do. My mission was born that year. I was to help give the Indian people in the outer villages clean drinking water. As a result of that visit Entrusted Grace Ministries was founded. With God's guidance and help, we work with Pastor Raju, who visits villages to dig fresh water wells. At the dedication of each well, he offers them the message of salvation. Each person who accepts Jesus as their personal Savior is presented with their own Bible in their native language. We distribute Bibles, clothes, and food to those that have a need. God saw the need to expand the work into Pakistan, to the persecuted Christians there. The Lord always does exceedingly more than we can ask or think...I have proven Him true so many times. If we are just willing, there is no limit to what God can do!</p>
